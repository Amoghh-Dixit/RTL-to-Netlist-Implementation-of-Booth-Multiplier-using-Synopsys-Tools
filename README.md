# RTL-to-Netlist-Implementation-of-Booth-Multiplier-using-Synopsys-Tools
This project designs an optimized Booth Multiplier for DSP applications, following RTL to netlist flow using Synopsys tools. It integrates DFT for testability, power-aware synthesis, and pipelining for efficiency. Verification ensures correctness through simulations and formal methods, meeting industry standards.
